# MasterThesisProject
Testing the influence of different pooling techniques on malware image classification

## Dataset
The dataset is not uploaded in this repository, due to the folder size of the dataset 
It can be downloaded from this link: https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/malimg

## Models
All trained and tested models can be found in the Models folder, which has "SimpleModel" and "VGG16" as subfolders,
where you can find the ".keras" model files

## Notebooks
In the Notebooks folder you can find three subfolders and two separate jupyter notebook files.
The jupyter notebook files are used for preprocessing the dataset.
The Evaluation folder contains the code for the testing process for every model.
The Simple Model and VGG16 folder contain the training code for every model.

## Pooling Layers
The implementation of the pooling layers can be found in the Pooling Layers folder.

## Results
The Results folder contains all classification reports for every model, saved as csv files.
